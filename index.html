  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>These heatmaps show how books are internally related, i.e. by breaking books into 1000-word segments, we can cross-compare the segments using a language model to show which segments are more related to one another. With this data, it's possible to look for internal relationships within a book, as well as relationships between two books.</p>
  <p>This page is an index of heatmaps showing comparisons between the Book of Mormon and other books.</p>
